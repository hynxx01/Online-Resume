    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Dedicated and technically proficient graduate of Bachelor of Science in
      Electronics Engineering, equipped with a strong academic background in
      circuit designing, layout designing, and basic Python programming. While I
      may lack professional experience, I have actively engaged in hands-on
      projects during my academic tenure, allowing me to develop a solid
      understanding of engineering principles and practical skills. Passionate
      about innovation and emerging technologies, I possess a keen eye for
      detail and a natural ability to troubleshoot and solve complex problems.
      Committed to continuous self-improvement and eager to contribute my
      knowledge and enthusiasm to a dynamic organization in the electronics
      engineering field.
